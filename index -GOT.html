          <h2>Episode 6: Beyond the Wall</h2>
          <p><span class="spoilertext">Why was Arya so pissed about how Sansa acted as a teen that she hinted she would like to see her tortured? How did this trouble Sansa so much that she immediately began plotting to kill her own sister? Why didn't she question Littlefinger's advice given she called him out earlier in the season? Why didn't she question where Arya got the letter from? Why does Daenerys oscillate between tyrant and tearful egalitarian? Why did Jon continue to slay wights after every member of the Still Breathing Seven (SBS) had boarded Drogon? What kind of lightning quick ravens have they got in Westeros? Why did the wights and white walkers just wait for ages around the edge when they had ice javelins the whole time? Why did they have Benjen save Jon, when it could have been Rhaegal swooping into the water and scooping up the secret Targaryen, better serving the over-arching narrative? How ridiculous and kamikaze was that whole SBS mission in retrospect?</span></p>

          <h2>Episode 5: Eastwatch</h2>
          <p>
          'Eastwatch' saw Tyrion head back to King's Landing for the first time since season four to find his brother Jaime in a bid to tell him he needs to convince Cersei of the approaching threat of the White Walkers that will render any battle for the Iron Throne completely pointless. His pitch? Cersei meets with Daenerys “to discuss an armistice” after Jon Snow - who will venture North of the Wall - has acquired proof that the White Walkers exist. </p>

          <h2>Episode 4: The Spoils of War</h2>
          <p>​Daenerys taking five to try and yank a spear out of Drogon's neck was annoyingly short-sighted, leaving her clearly vulnerable, while the decision to end the episode with a cliffhanger that isn't really a cliffhanger (Jaime will almost certainly survive) seemed like a missed opportunity, the 'is he dead or alive?' narrative overshadowing the 'Jesus, Daenerys is pretty capricious and short-tempered huh' one that should have been at the fore.</p>
